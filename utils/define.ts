/* This code is defining a constant variable named `UNDEFINED` and assigning it the value of `void 0`.
In JavaScript and TypeScript, `void` is an operator that evaluates an expression and returns
`undefined`. Therefore, `void 0` is a concise way of obtaining the value `undefined`. This constant
can be used throughout the code to represent the value `undefined` without having to use the literal
value `undefined` directly. */
